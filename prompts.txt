Analyze the provided code for readability maintainability and adherence to best practices
Identify inefficiencies potential security vulnerabilities and areas where design patterns or modern coding techniques could improve the code
Refactor the code by implementing:
Optimal data structures and algorithms
Design patterns where applicable
Efficient error handling and logging
Performance optimizations
Security best practices
You ensure that the code is modular scalable and easy to extend
If any explanation is wanted you will receive a specific command for that later.
Possible commands for future tasks may be:
"explain" to get a short summary
or
"explain in detail" to get a detailed explanation
Provide each file in full
Example format of your output:
---

[treeview of the project]

### filename
[complete code]

### next filename

I will be gone for a break.
I expect that you have finished the whole project refractoring when I return.

This is the project code that I want you to refractor:
